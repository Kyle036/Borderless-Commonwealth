How do we solve world hunger twice while saving over $1.26 Trillion dollars? Please Share!
What if I told you that we could feed every hungry person in the world twice, while putting an additional $1.26 Trillion dollars back into our pockets to spend however we'd like. How about we sweeten the deal and take an extra $2.02 Trillion in tax write-off's at the end of each year? We can! The solution is actually pretty simple but at the same time is a daunting task. It's as simple as buying from ourselves. What do I mean buying from ourselves? If you were to own an electronics company, would you buy your television from another retailer or would you save money by buying from yourself? Obviously, you're going to skip the markup and buy your own product. How does this example apply to world hunger or any worldwide problem? Because the solution we are looking for is as simple as owning a company together. This seems like a complicated endeavor but it's not. It would have been impossible even 20 years ago but innovations such as Facebook and blockchain technology have actually made this task feasible. 
How does an entire world work together on a single company?
The concept is quite easy. It is a company owned by every single person on earth at the same time. When you are born, you automatically earn a share and lose it when you pass. The company would run like any other company meaning that it would have an elected set of officers and administrative staff, however, the Board of Director's would be run on a 24 hour system similar to Facebook. To help prevent corruption, the voting and comments system would be founded on Blockchain technology. To briefly describe how blockchain would prevent corruption, every user that processes votes or comments would have access to a log of all transactions and algorithms would dictate whether the information shared between them was valid. 
To illustrate how the voting and comment system would work, imagine that somebody in one part of the world says, "Crocodiles should wear tennis shoes". We don't find that information very helpful so if user's don't "like" the comment or essentially "Vote up" the comment, it will fizzle out and not everyone needs to read it. However, idea's that people truly appreciate will go viral and rise to the top, allowing them to be called to a vote. We would then have an alotted amount of time to vote on the topic. Yes... we have the technology to vote on every important topic individually without massive structures and bureaucracies! How does this system fit into our very different economic and social views? It doesn't. It is not the Government! It is an attempt at finding the middle ground between Capitalism, Socialism and Communism in a way that is financially beneficial to everyone. But the reality is that it's simply a company that acts as an economic branch of the People! 
How does a company solve world problems such as hunger, while giving you the lowest price?
Imagine that you operate a non-profit organization that is raising money for food, housing or really anything. You come to our corporation and register as a non-profit and once approved, you may find any product to offer to patrons to help raise money. For example, you can buy a Sceptre 55" 4k Ultra television at Walmart for $258. Walmart purchases these televisions from unnamed manufacturing facilities in China. Together, we can purchase a comparable television set from similar verified manufacturer's using Alibab.com for $49 each, assuming we order them in quantity. After adding in shipping and allowing Amazon fulfillment center's to process the order's, we are looking at approximately $107 for each television set. Now let's assume that the charitable organzation that is selling the televisions sets the sales price at $200, which is $58 lower than the comparable product sold at a retailer. This price isn't completely unreasonable considering we doubled the original starting price of $49 and then doubled again at the distributor level. The end result gives the charitable organization $93 for each television sold while at the same time giving the consumer $58 in savings. Furthermore, the consumer now has a $93 tax write-off for purchasing a product that they intended to buy anyway... To sweeten the deal, the television is now branded in their favorite charities name, rather than someone that they've never heard of. 
Please note the example below assumes all electronics are sold through our company to achieve the goal. This is not feasible, however, allocating a small portion of each market to this strategy is not unfeasible over time. The example is used for simplicity but markup's across different global markets are very similar.
Now let's use an imaginary example and extrapolate this information out to a much larger scale. There are 811 million starving people on earth. According to ourworldindata.org, the average cost to feed one person worldwide is $3.54. Based on this information, it would cost approximately $1.05 Trillion to feed every hungry person on this planet. Now, using the television example and knowing that markups across all products globally may differ but average out to a similar double double approach, we can find out what it'd take to feed the world. In 2022, 544 Million televisions were sold and televisions were slightly under 25% of the global electronics market. So multiplying $93 by 544 Million televisions leaves us with $50.5 Billion in donations. We then multiply our savings of $58 by 544 Million televisions and find that we just saved $31.5 Billion as well. Now because televisions are 25% of the electronics market, let's multiply our number's by four to see what would happen if the entire electronics market was through our own company. We end up with $202 Billion in donations, while saving $126 Billion. OK, so the entire world's GDP is approximately $94 Trillion and the global electronics market is about $1.062 Trillion. This means that the electronics market cover's 1.1% of worldwide GDP (1.062 Tr/94 Tr). For easy math, let's multiply our number's by 10 to assume that 11% of our purchases came through our own company. $202 Billion by 10 puts us at $2.02 Trillion in donations, which doubles our goal for ending world hunger... $126 Billion by 10 puts us at a savings of $1.26 Trillion. And all of this could be achieved while earning $2.02 Trillion in tax write-offs. 
Again, I'm not asking us to switch everything to our own company, but rather a small portion of everything. Even 5% would solve huge problems. If you think that we can't do it, look at Jeff Bezo's... He might do it himself over the next 20 years. 
How do we make something so big possible?
This project seems huge. Almost overwhelming! But it's not. The funding is in the proof of concept itself. We simply find a few products to test as a proof of concept. The revenue from these products will go towards initial executives and programming needed to make the voting system a reality. This idea is for anyone. If you want to take it, I don't mind. Please share this post if you like it.
Thank you to the Accountant's, Financial Analysts and random people I spoke with to determine whether this is feasible or just an ideological nightmare! Also, please note that this is just a start and I would expect it to evolve into something more suitable for everyone. The goal is to layout a workable concept that we may ALL build on and improve over time. Thanks!

400 TV's fit in 20' container 800 in 40' container
cost added per tv = $21.25 for 20' container
cost added per tv = $18.75 for 40' container
TV cost with shipping $49 + 18.75 = $67.75
TV cost with fulfillment center costs = $77.14
Amazon 15% with selling price of $200 = $107.14
Savings for consumer = $258 - 200 = $58
Tax write off for consumer = 200 - 107.14 = $92.86
Donation to charity = $92.86
Charity donations If all televisions worldwide were sold this way (544 million x 92.86) = 50.5 billion
consumer tax write-offs if all sold this way = 50.5 billion
 consumer savings if all sold this way (544 million x 58) = 31.5 Billion
Televisions as % of global electronics market (259.16B / 1.062 Tr) = 24.38%
Donations Rough estimate if all electronics were sold this way = (4 x 50.5 Billion) = 202 Billion
Tax write-offs rough estimate if all electronics were sold this way = (4 x 50.5 Billion) = 202 Billion
Savings rough estimate if all electronics were sold this way = (4 x 31.5 Billion) = 126 Billion
% of consumer electronics market to total worldwide GDP = (1.062 Tr / 94 Tr) = 1.1%
Assuming similar markups across categories, donations if 11% of worldwide products were sold this way = (202 Billion * 10) = 2.02 Tr
Assuming similar markups across categories, tax write-offs if 11% of worldwide products were sold this way = (202 Billion * 10) = 2.02 Tr
Assuming similar markups across categories, savings if 11% of worldwide products were sold this way = (126 Billion * 10) = 1.26 Trillion
